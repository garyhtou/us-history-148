# US History III

_HIST&148 at Bellevue College_

I took this class back in Winter 2020 as a running start student (Dual-Enrollment) at Bellevue College. I thought these notes might be helpful to some, so I have open-sourced them here. They were originally taken in a Google Doc that I have exported as an HTML file.

By no means are these notes perfect, there are most likely a couple of typos here and there. They're just the raw notes from when I took the class. Enjoy!
